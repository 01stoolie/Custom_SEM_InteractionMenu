# Custom_SEM_InteractionMenu

Multi Purpose FiveM Interaction Menu Customized

This resource is a menu with actions for LEO, Fire, Civ including Vehicle Controls, Emotes and a Staff Menu!

Each section has features that would be used by each of the professions, for example the LEO Menu has Cuff, Drag, Seat, etc.
